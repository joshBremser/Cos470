Your experience programming, with c#, with Git.
    I've taken programming classes since like 2014 and I intern at Idexx doing dev stuff, mostly Angular, Java, and Dart.
    I took a C# class in 2017 where we used windows forms and console apps.
    I used Git in COS420 and I use it at work: comfortable with committing, merging, branches, etc.

Topics that interest you
    I've been learning Flutter at work which has been a lot of fun.

Career goals
    I'm planning on staying where I am until I graduate and can be hired full-time.

What you want to get out of this class
    Learn some new technologies that I didn't know well before

Learning style
    I learn best being given a task and then left to struggle until I figure it out.

Anything else you'd like me to know
    Nah
